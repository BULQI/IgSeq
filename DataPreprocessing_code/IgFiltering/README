# README about Ig data filtering.

## Bowtie2 filtering.

First step of Ig data filtering is to run bowtie2 to filter out obviously non-Ig sequences.
This way, we significantly lower the noise in the downstream analysis. Please check the file named 
"IgFilter_script" for detailed information on the calling of bowtie2.

## Fastq data generation.

In this step, we run an R script to go through bam files generated in the previous step and 
rewrite the data into the fastq format again and make them available for the next processing pipeline.

The calling of the run is as follows,

    R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore    '--args bamfiles=<name of bam file>'   mapSam_script.R  <running log file name>
