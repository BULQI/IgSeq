# ReadMe about preparing data for running R scripts

## Data set
Two pieces of data sets are needed. At this point, you need to download them from the below links

- Bone marrow Ig data
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hbyAXIFdGHy2DXVNE2GL3OUYWeB4HqMj/view?usp=drive_link

- Spleen Ig data
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16MHSVRpnaTm1dX40wNaxRIre51gd7Enw/view?usp=drive_link

After downloading, please extract the data into the ../../Data folder. Make sure you have two folders, BM and SP,
to hold the bone marrow and spleen data, respectively.

## Scripts
Three scripts are available in the folder. Please run them in order:

- 1) DataAnalysis_v1.0_geneUsage_data.R

- 2) Datanalysis_v1.0_clone_data.R

- 3) processAlignmentLenOfV.R

These scripts will read input and process them and eventually write output to the correct folders in order to
generate data and figures in the manuscripts.
