describe the workflow of the data analysis

- 1) data prepare/preprocessing
    
- 2) Figure 2, IGHV gene usage.
     Figure 3, Mutation frequency
     Figure 4, CDR3 length.
     Figure 5, Clonal diversity
     Figure 6, Clonal selection strength
     Figure 7, Unsupervised machine learning of all Ig data.
     
     Note: no figure 1 (showing the experimental protocol and data preprocessing).
