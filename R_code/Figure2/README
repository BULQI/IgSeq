# Read me about the code and data

## Code files

- 1) figure4_plotting_v1.0.r

This is the file to draw final figure (Figure 2) in the manuscript. It loaded the saved data and did plotting. (See Readme for other code files and data sets).

Note: the file NAME is for the old version of manuscript and is not in the order of the latest one, but the code are correct.

- 2) DataAnalysis_v2.0_geneUsage_composition_figure4_noZeroMu.r

This is the file to generate data using the data set without Zero mutations (likely memory cells??). At this current memont we, specifically,
want to test the data set for calculating alpha cronbach (pcaData_cronbachAlapha.RData). Somehow, both saved data (in full dataset folder and noZeroMu folder) are the same. We want to resolve the mystery.
