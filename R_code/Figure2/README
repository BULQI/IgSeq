## Code files

Please make sure you run the R code files in the following order. 

- 1) DataAnalysis_v2.0_geneUsage_composition_figure4.r

This is the file to run analysis and generate data for plotting the final figures using the full data set. 
This module assume the input files are either manually copied to the ../Data/Figure2 folder or you have run the data preprocessing programs.

- 2) PC_consistency_CronbachA.R

This is the file to run Cronbach alpha analysis and generate data for plotting. 

- 3) figure4_plotting_v1.0.r

This is the file to draw final figure (Figure 2) in the manuscript. It loaded the saved data and did plotting. (See Readme for other code files and data sets).
