This folder are used to hold the data for plotting Figure 4 in the manuscript. These data are either the input data for the R scripts in the /R_code/Figure4 or the temporary data generated by those R scripts. 

1) Ig.good.RecSum.df.RData and All.RecSum.df.RData
These are the input data for the R scripts in /R_code/Figure4.
There are two way to generate it: 
    i) Run the steps in /DataPreprocessing_code folder to finish the data proprocessing and then run the scripts in /R_code/DataPrepare.
    ii) Download the data prepared by the author from
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w_XakwmcFAeC0crj-7cRifc48tQ6wh2_/view?usp=sharing
    
    and
    
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EhZb638gBx_F1MO5O2DKjkCTHr9A72K6/view?usp=sharing

2) all other data files are generated by running the R scripts in /R_code/Figure4. Some of them will be used by other scripts in other figures. Don't delete them if you don't know what to do with them.
