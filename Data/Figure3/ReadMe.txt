This folder are used to hold the data for plotting Figure 3 in the manuscript. These data are either the input data for the R scripts in the /R_code/Figure3 or the temporary data generated by those R scripts. 

1) the input data for plotting Figure 3 are individual recombination summary files
(*.Recombinationsummaries.txt).
These files are saved at ../SP and ../BM.

There are two way to generate it: 
    i) Run the steps in /DataPreprocessing_code folder to finish the data proprocessing and then run the scripts in /R_code/DataPrepare.
    ii) Download the data prepared by the author from
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSXHZsTFrmyRXzYXn3T2W2-Znr12ClpT/view?usp=sharing

    and 
    
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/17BZwsdRcq4qAiz_0P0G0mPzecyekQDxj/view?usp=sharing
    
    then extract them at the fold /Data. At the end, you will have two folder /Data/BM and /Data/SP, each of which
    contains individual recombination summary files by sample.
    
2) all other data files are generated by running the R scripts in /R_code/Figure3. Some of them will be used by other scripts in other figures. Don't delete them if you don't know what to do with them.
