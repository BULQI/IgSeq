This folder are used to hold the data for plotting Figure 6 in the manuscript. These data are either the input data for the R scripts in the /R_code/Figure6 or the temporary data generated by those R scripts. 

1) clones.df.RData, cloneAssignment_df.RData, mutations_df.RData, df.vlength.RData and Ig.good.RecSum.df.RData
These are the input data for the R scripts in /R_code/Figure6.
There are two way to generate them: 
    i) Run the steps in /DataPreprocessing_code folder to finish the data proprocessing and then run the scripts in /R_code/DataPrepare.
    ii) Download the data prepared by the author from

2) all other data files are generated by running the R scripts in /R_code/Figure6. Some of them will be used by other scripts in other figures. Don't delete them if you don't know what to do with them.
