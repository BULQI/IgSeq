This folder are used to hold the data for plotting Figure 7 in the manuscript. These data are either the input data for the R scripts in the /R_code/Figure7 or the temporary data generated by those R scripts. 

1) Input data are generated in the previous figures and we read them in the scripts for plotting Figure 7
see scripts for details.

2) all other data files are generated by running the R scripts in /R_code/Figure7. Some of them will be used by other scripts in other figures. Don't delete them if you don't know what to do with them.
