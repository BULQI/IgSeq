1) sample.geneUsage.RData
This is the input data for the R scripts in /R_code/Figure2.
There are two way to generate it: 
    i) Run the steps in /DataPreprocessing_code folder to finish the data proprocessing and then run the scripts in /R_code/DataPrepare..
    ii) Download the data prepared by the author from
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/17QLxPEoh3cKs33DMqtiRsXUZibaJIOwY/view?usp=sharing

2) all other data files are generated by running the R scripts in /R_code/Figure2. Some of them will be used by other scripts in other figures. Don't delete them if you don't know what to do with them.
